## What is Illucidate?

Illucidate is an open-source toolkit for discovering **multivariate, time-structured patterns** in bacterial detection assays that enable earlier, more reliable pathogen identification.

---

## Why I Built This

Most of my work has been on early detection of foodborne pathogens using bioluminescent reporter phages—specifically *E. coli* O157:H7 with engineered phages ΦV10::NanoLuc and ΦV10::lux. 

**The frustration:** We collect *so much data* during these assays (OD at multiple wavelengths, bioluminescence, temperature, timing), but traditional analysis looks at each measurement in isolation. Testing protocols split samples into separate pathways, each running a different confirmation test, hoping to detect the pathogen in *one* of them.

**The realization:** What if we're already collecting the signals we need? What if the **combination** of measurements—the ratios, the timing differences, the cross-channel patterns—contains information that's invisible when we look at each measurement alone?

**The goal:** Combine what we already have. Build smarter detection pathways that need *fewer tests*, generate *less waste*, and get answers *faster*. Not by collecting more data, but by actually *seeing* what's already there.

That's Illucidate—bringing the hidden signals to light.

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install illucidate
```

Or clone and install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jaegertros/illucidate.git
cd illucidate
pip install -e .
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from illucidate.adapters import VictorNivoAdapter
from illucidate.core import FeatureGenerator, find_early_signals

# Load your data
adapter = VictorNivoAdapter('experiment.xlsx')
data = adapter.parse()

# Define experimental design
design = {
    'A1': {'bacteria': 'E.coli_O157H7', 'phage': 'Yes'},
    'A2': {'bacteria': 'E.coli_O157H7', 'phage': 'No'},
    # ...
}

# Generate features
generator = FeatureGenerator(data, design)
features = generator.generate_all()

# Find early detection signals
signals = find_early_signals(features, compare='phage')

# Top signal might be:
# "OD600_time_to_12x" - effect size: 31.5
# With phage: 1.2 hours | Without phage: 8.5 hours
```

## Features

### 🔧 Modular Design
- **Standalone components** - Use just the feature generator, just the statistical tests, or the full pipeline
- **Extensible adapters** - Add support for new plate readers easily
- **Import as needed** - No bloated dependencies

### 📊 Comprehensive Analysis
- **100+ features** per sample including:
  - Early timepoint statistics (mean, slope, max of first 3, 5, 10, 15, 20 measurements)
  - Growth characteristics (max rate, time to max rate, acceleration)
  - Lag detection (time to reach 1.1x, 1.2x, 1.5x, 2.0x baseline)
  - Cross-measurement features (ratios, correlations, temporal relationships)

### 🎯 Statistical Rigor
- T-tests with multiple comparison correction
- Effect size calculations (Cohen's d)
- False discovery rate control
- Ranked by discriminative power

### 🔌 Multiple Plate Reader Support
- Victor Nivo (Perkin Elmer)
- BioTek Synergy
- Tecan Spark/Infinite
- Generic CSV/Excel formats
- *Add your own adapter in ~50 lines of Python*

### 📈 Rich Visualizations
- Growth curve overlays (colored by experimental variables)
- Signal ranking plots
- Interaction heatmaps
- Time-to-detection comparisons

---

## Use Cases

### 🔬 Research & Development
